# Machine Learning: the Gathering
Using machine learning to predict what your opponent is playing in Magic: the Gathering

Check out the [notebook in this repository](MLtG.ipynb), that describes step by step you you can build a classifier that can predict the deck 
your opponent is playing based on a few cards you've seen during the first few rounds.

If you just want to play with the classifier, you can download these from the releases.
