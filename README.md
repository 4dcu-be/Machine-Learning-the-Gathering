# Machine Learning: the Gathering
Using machine learning to predict what your opponent is playing in Magic: the Gathering

This repository belongs to a post on [4DCu.be](https://blog.4dcu.be), you can read the corresponding article on : http://blog.4dcu.be/programming/games/2019/12/29/Magic-the-Gathering.html

Check out the [notebook in this repository](MLtG.ipynb), that describes step by step you you can build a classifier that can predict the deck 
your opponent is playing based on a few cards you've seen during the first few rounds.

If you just want to play with the classifier, you can download these from the [releases](https://github.com/4dcu-be/Machine-Learning-the-Gathering/releases/tag/v1.0). The code how to load and use this is included in the notebook (step 5)
